2. The Menu:
        Had hidden menu by default.
        Display when clicked.
        Not display when clicked again.
        
3. Initial Entries:
        Atleast a single entry in .feed container and LoadFeed function is called.

4. New Feed Selection:
        A new feed is loaded by LoadFeed function.
